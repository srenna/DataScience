# 👋 Welcome to My Portfolio!
Dive into my collection of projects, showcasing my expertise in data analysis and related fields. Each project represents a unique opportunity to explore various aspects of data science. If you have any questions or wish to discuss collaboration opportunities, feel free to reach out.

## 📂 Project List
### 1. Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis 🧹📊
In this project, I employ robust data cleaning techniques, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of datasets. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), I uncover hidden patterns and insights critical for decision-making. For example, in the "Ecommerce Sales Data Analysis" project, I meticulously cleaned and analyzed sales data to identify key performance indicators and regional trends, which guided the formulation of a data-driven sales strategy.

### 2. Statistical & AB Testing 📈📊
Statistical analysis and A/B testing are at the core of this project, where I assess the significance of changes and their impact. In the "Mobile App Feature Testing" project, as a Product Analyst, I conducted A/B tests to measure changes in click-through rates (CTR) and average time spent on the mobile app. This involved rigorous statistical hypothesis testing to make data-driven decisions, ultimately leading to feature improvements.

### 3. Regression & Regularization 📈📉
This project delves deep into regression and regularization techniques for predictive modeling. Specifically, in the "House Price Prediction" project, I employed Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression, LASSO, Ridge, and Elastic Net regression methods to predict house prices based on a range of features. This required advanced model evaluation and feature engineering to identify the main drivers of the housing market.

### 4. Web Visit Churn Analysis 🌐📈
The "Beauty and Fashion E-commerce" project, which has been recently renamed, focuses on analyzing web visit churn and extracting insights into user behavior. By conducting cohort analysis, funnel analysis, and user segmentation, I identified factors influencing user checkout behavior. This involved advanced techniques such as retention rate calculation and product recommendation systems.

### 5. Data Imbalances 📉🤖
Previously titled, this project tackles the challenging issue of data imbalances in machine learning. Using exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling, I addressed the problem in the context of a high-risk business, reducing chargebacks, refunds, and failed payments. Techniques such as SMOTE and ensemble methods were employed to handle imbalanced datasets effectively.

### 6. End to End Classification 🤖🔍
The "Grocery Subscription Churn Analysis" project is currently being organized to provide an in-depth view of end-to-end classification tasks. This includes data cleaning, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation. Additionally, the project delves into the business implications of the analysis, providing a comprehensive understanding of customer churn and retention.

### 7. SQL Queries 📊💼
In this project, I've curated a diverse collection of SQL queries to address various data tasks. Using SQL, I analyzed sales data for a bakery, conducting tasks such as data aggregation, filtering, and summarization. This highlights my proficiency in leveraging SQL for data manipulation and analysis.

### 8. Web Scraping & Data Pipelines 🌐🚀
The "Government Weather Alerts Integration" project showcases my expertise in web scraping and data pipeline development. By scraping weather data from the government of Canada's alerts directory and funneling it into a data pipeline, I enabled daily weather alerts for a logistics company. This project demonstrates my ability to acquire data from unconventional sources and automate data workflows.
